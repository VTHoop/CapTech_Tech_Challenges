# Data Science and Visualization Tech Challenge 2

#### Overview

Based on the initial data exploration in Tech Challenge 1, this Tech Challenge will develop and test hypotheses about the data analyzed previously.

Files not named "LetsImprove" were the first iteration of the visualization of this project.  Upon research of the Seaborn library and stronger use of its functions, the "LetsImprove" files reduce the amount of code and improve visualization for the project.

The Pickle files in the library were used to save down the samples chosen from the populations, so that a new sample would not be generated when the project was paused and resumed.

#### Formats

This iPython notebook (and its published outputs) use Python and additional Python libraries

#### Libraries Used

Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Pyplot, Collections, Time, Datetime
